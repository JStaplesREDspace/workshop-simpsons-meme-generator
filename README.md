# The Simpsons Meme Workshop

In this workshop, we will learn a little about Svelte and a little about memes. :)

## Instructions

We will use the `0-sandbox/` folder to build our app. You can either follow along, or jump around the app with the enumerated steps.

> For each branch, you can read the README.md if you prefer text instructions.

If you fall behind, don't worry! You can borrow code from the current step, or switch to that step and follow along from there.

## Saving your Work

You can save your work by making an account here on https://codesandbox.io and saving your sandbox.

## Navigate through the Steps

> Add /#/? where the ? is the number you want to go to.

If you are following along with the steps, just add `/#/?`, where the ? will be the step you want to work from in the view on the right.
For example, your route might look like this: `https://4ubvd.csb.app/#/9`. Make sure the 5 random characters at the front of your url match the characters in your url in your web browser.

## Svelte
